Since version 1.12, Trendz supports a variety of languages to ensure a seamless user experience across different regions. Right now, the following languages are supported out of the box, but this list will be expanded over time:
* English
* Spanish
* French
* German

Trendz uses the language you select for a user in ThingsBoard. This setting automatically determines the language displayed in Trendz. If Trendz doesn’t support a language, it will default to English. 
Also, you can add new translations or customize existing ones to fit your needs.

To modify or add translation for another languages follow next steps:
* Open the Custom Translation tab from the White Labeling menu.

* Choose the language that you want to modify. 
* View and manage translation keys. Trendz uses a predefined set of translation keys to manage its interface. You can find a complete list of these keys in this JSON file (here would be a link to download the file with our translations). 
* Once you’ve entered or updated your translations, save your changes and refresh your Trendz instance to apply them.
