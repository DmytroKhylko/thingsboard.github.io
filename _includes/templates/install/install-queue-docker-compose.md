ThingsBoard supports two messaging systems/brokers for storing the messages: In-memory and Kafka.

**In Memory** queue implementation is not suitable for any sort of cluster deployments, so you should use **Kafka**.


See corresponding architecture [page](/docs/reference/#message-queues-are-awesome) and rule engine [page](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-5/queues/) for more details.
